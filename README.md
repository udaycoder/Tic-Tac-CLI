A CLI Tic Tac Toe Game that I made during the early days of my engineering bachelors. Along with the basic player vs player mode it also has a player vs AI mode. The AI is a rule based AI coded through nothing but simple logic :-).

It's entirely coded in c++. Just use a g++ compiler and compile and run the application to play.
